    "# You all have used the random library of python. You have seen in the screen-cast of how powerful it is.\n",
    "# In this assignment, you will sort a list let's say list_1 of numbers in increasing order using the random library.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Following are the steps to sort the numbers using the random library.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 1: Import the randint definition of the random library of python. Check this page if you want some help.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 2: Take the elements of the list_1 as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 3: randomly choose two indexes i and j within the range of the size of list_1.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 4: Swap the elements present at the indexes i and j. After doing this, check whether the list_1 is sorted or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 5: Repeat step 3 and 4 until the array is not sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Input Format:\n",
    "# The first line contains a single number n which signifies the number of elements in the list_1.\n",
    "# From the second line, the elements of the list_1 are given with each number in a new line.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Output Format:\n",
    "# Print the elements of the list_1 in a single line with each element separated by a space. \n",
    "# NOTE 1: There should not be any space after the last element.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Input:\n",
    "# 4\n",
    "# 3\n",
    "# 1\n",
    "# 2\n",
    "# 5\n",
    "\n",
    "# Output:\n",
    "# 1 2 3 5\n",
    "\n",
    "# Explanation: \n",
    "# The first line of the input is 4. Which means that n is 4, or the number of elements in list_1 is 4. The elements of list_1 are 3, 1, 2, 5 in this order.\n",
    "# The sorted version of this list is 1 2 3 5, which is the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "# NOTE 2: There are many ways to sort the elements of a list. The purpose of this assignment is to show the power of randomness, and obviously it's fun."
